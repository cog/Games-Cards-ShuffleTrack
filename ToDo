To Do list:

 * new deck
    * allow for user-specified order
    * start a deck with a specific number of cards
    * move the different deck orders to submodules

 * changing a deck
    * remove cards from a deck
        * $deck->remove_random();    # remove a random card
        * $deck->remove_random( 5 ); # remove five cards or remove the 5th card?
    * replace? ("to replace a card in the deck")
    * lose? ("to lose a card in the deck")
    * count how many of a specific card are present in the deck

 * shuffling
    * the wash
    * riffle shuffle
    	* riffle stacking
        * we're not considering how fast each half is being depleted nor whether the packets riffled on each side are of similar sizes
    * faro
        * faro X cards from the top
        * anti-faro
    * milk shuffle and variations

 * cutting
    * cut a pile on to another pile
        * $deck->complete_cut_to( $another_deck );
    * move a pile on to another pile # isn't this the same as complete_cut_to?
        * $deck->move_to( $another_pile );
    * bury top 10 cards under next 5
        * $deck->uncut( 10, 5 );

 * documentation
    * document what happens if you try to faro a deck with an odd number of cards
    * acknowledgments
    * update the list of recommended books
    * add a glossary
        * balance of the deck
        * top/bottom stock
    * create links on README.md to facilitate navigation on Github
    * update the descriptions of the different shuffles

 * testing
    * rearrange the tests and cleanup the variable names in the tests
    * bottom dealing to the top is the same as double uppercut
    * bottom replacement a second deal is the same as a double undercut

 * advanced
    * controlled multiple cuts (e.g., cut the top X cards under position N)
    * given a series of procedures and a desired final result, assert the initial order of the deck
    * track relationship between cards:
        - from a specific order and through a series of procedures, present conclusions about the end relationship
    * moving cards between places:
        - e.g., set three new positions - $hand, $table and $spectator - and deal cards from $hand alternatively to $table and $spectator)
    * given an initial deck order and a series of procedures, run that sequence X times to analyze the outcome (e.g., 1st card usually ends in certain positions)

 * games
    * analyze hands in different games (poker, blackjack, etc)
