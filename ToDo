    * given a series of procedures and a desired final result, assert the initial order of the deck
    * maintain relationship through cards; from a specific order and through a series of procedures, ascertain axioms about the end result
    * moving cards between places (e.g., set three new positions - $hand, $table and $spectator - and deal cards from $hand alternatively to $table and $spectator)
    * given an initial deck order and a series of procedures, run that sequence X times to analyze the outcome (e.g., 1st card usually ends in certain positions)
