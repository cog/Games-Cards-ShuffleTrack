To Do list:

 * new deck
    * implement other orders other than new deck order
    * allow for user-specified order
    * start a deck with a specific number of cards

 * checks
    * get the position of a specific card
        * $deck->find( 'AS' ); # find the Ace of Spades
    * get the relative position of one card to another
        * $deck->find( 'AS', 'KH' ); # find the relative position of the King of Hearts to the Ace of Spades
    * get the card immediately before/after a specific card
        * $deck->card_before( 'AS' );
        * $deck->card_after(  'AS' );

 * changing a deck
    * remove cards from a deck
        * $deck->remove_random();    # remove a random card
        * $deck->remove_random( 5 ); # remove five cards
    * add cards to a deck (specific cards or random cards)
        * $deck->add( $card ); # add $card to the deck at a random position
        * $deck->add( $card, 20 ); # add $card to the deck at position 20

 * documentation
    * document what happens if you try to faro a deck with an odd number of cards
    * acknowledgments
    * update the list of recommended books
    * add a glossary
        * balance of the deck
        * top/bottom stock

 * shuffling
    * allow for an option on shuffles and cuts to do the procedure X times
    * riffle shuffle
        * $deck->riffle_shuffle( 'short' );
        * $deck->riffle_shuffle( 'deep'  );
        * $deck->riffle_shuffle( 26 ); # divide the deck in precisely half
    	* riffle stacking
        * on the riffle shuffle we're not considering how fast each half is being depleted nor whether the packets riffled on each side are of similar sizes
 	* hindu shuffle
 	* overhand shuffle
    * faro
        * faro X cards from the top
        * anti-faro

 * cutting the deck
    * running cuts
    * cut at a specific card (we assume the operator has a way of doing this regardless of the position of the card)
        * $deck->cut_below('AS'); # cutting right above the Ace of Spades
        * $deck->cut_above('KH'); # cutting right below the King of Hearts

 * advanced
    * include whether the deck is face up or face down so that you can do some moves with the cards facing the opposite direction (e.g., running cards from the face)
    * given a series of procedures and a desired final result, assert the initial order of the deck
    * maintain relationship through cards; from a specific order and through a series of procedures, ascertain axioms about the end result
    * moving cards between places (e.g., set three new positions - $hand, $table and $spectator - and deal cards from $hand alternatively to $table and $spectator)
