        $deck->remove( 'AS' ); # remove the Ace of Spades
    * drop cards from the deck
        $deck->drop( 10 ); # same as dribble, but targeted at the cards being dropped instead of the cards held
        $deck->drop( -4 ); # drop until only 4 cards remain
    * deal X cards
        $deck->deal( 5, $pile );
        $deck->deal( $pile, 5 );
        my $pile = $deck->deal( 5 );
        $deck->deal( 5, @hands, 'alternate' ); # deals one card at a time to all hands
        $deck->deal( 5, @hands, 'together' );  # deals 5 cards to a hand at a time
	* dribble
		$deck->dribble_above( 'KS' );
		$deck->dribble_below( 'KS' );

 * shuffling
    * the wash
    * riffle shuffle
    	* riffle stacking
    * faro
        * faro X cards from the top
        * anti-faro
            $deck->anti-faro( $pile1, $pile2 );
    * shuffle the deck

 * documentation
    * document what happens if you try to faro a deck with an odd number of cards
    * acknowledgments
    * create links on README.md to facilitate navigation on Github
    * update the descriptions of the different shuffles

 * testing
    * rearrange the tests and cleanup the variable names in the tests
    * run perlcritic on the tests and solve the issues

 * advanced
    * given a series of procedures and a desired final result, assert the initial order of the deck
    * track relationship between cards: from a specific order and through a series of procedures, present conclusions about the end relationship
    * given an initial deck order and a series of procedures, run that sequence X times to analyze the outcome (e.g., 1st card usually ends in certain positions)
    * implement counting systems
        * hi.lo

 * warnings
    * warn when trying to find something in an empty deck

 * games
    * poker
        * sort cards in a hand
        * analyze hands (value)
        * make the best hand out of X cards
