To Do list:

 * implement other orders other than new deck order
 * allow for user-specified order
 * start a deck with a specific number of cards
 * remove cards from a deck
 * add cards to a deck (specific cards or random cards)
 * document what happens if you try to faro a deck with an odd number of cards
 * allow for an option on shuffles and cuts to do the procedure X times
 * include whether the deck is face up or face down so that you can do some moves with the cards facing the opposite direction (e.g., running cards from the face)

 * shuffling
 	* hindu shuffle
 	* overhand shuffle
    * faro
        * faro out
        * faro X cards from the top

 * running cuts
 * cut (somewhere between 10 and 43 cards)
 * cut center (not the exact center but somewhere near the center, between 19 and 31)
 * cut short (just the top of the deck; somewhere between 5 and 15 cards)
 * cut deep (somewhere between 35 and 45)
 * cut at a specific card (assume the operator has a way of doing this regardless of the position of the card)

 * given a series of procedures and a desired final result, assert the initial order of the deck

 * maintain relationship through cards; from a specific order and through a series of procedures, ascertain axioms about the end result
