To Do list:

 * new deck
    * start a deck with a specific number of cards
    * move the different deck orders to submodules
    * ->deck_size should probably be ->size or ->get_size (perhaps implement aliases?)

 * changing a deck
    * remove cards from a deck
        * $deck->remove_random();    # remove a random card
        * $deck->remove_random( 5 ); # remove five cards
    * replace? ("to replace a card in the deck")
    * lose? ("to lose a card in the deck")
    * count how many of a specific card are present in the deck
    * dribble cards
        $deck->dribble( $pile );
        $pile = $deck->dribble;
        $deck->dribble( 10 );
        $deck->dribble( -10 );
        $deck->dribble( 10, 20 );
        $deck->dribble( 10, -10 );

 * shuffling
    * the wash
    * riffle shuffle
    	* riffle stacking
        * we're not considering how fast each half is being depleted nor whether the packets riffled on each side are of similar sizes
    * faro
        * faro X cards from the top
        * anti-faro
    * milk shuffle and variations

 * cutting
    * bury top 10 cards under next 5
        * $deck->uncut( 10, 5 );
        * $deck->undo( 10, 5 );
    * slip cut

 * documentation
    * document what happens if you try to faro a deck with an odd number of cards
    * acknowledgments
    * add a glossary
        * balance of the deck
        * top/bottom stock
    * create links on README.md to facilitate navigation on Github
    * update the descriptions of the different shuffles

 * testing
    * rearrange the tests and cleanup the variable names in the tests

 * advanced
    * controlled multiple cuts (e.g., cut the top X cards under position N)
    * given a series of procedures and a desired final result, assert the initial order of the deck
    * track relationship between cards: from a specific order and through a series of procedures, present conclusions about the end relationship
    * given an initial deck order and a series of procedures, run that sequence X times to analyze the outcome (e.g., 1st card usually ends in certain positions)
    * implement counting systems

 * games
    * poker
        * order cards in a hand
        * analyze hands (value)
        * make the best hand out of X cards
        * compare hands
    * blackjack
        * analyze hands (value)
        * compare hands
