=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module allows you to simulate shuffles and cuts.

	use Games::Cards::ShuffleTrack;

	my $deck = Games::Cards::ShuffleTrack->new();

	$deck->overhand_shuffle( 2 );
	$deck->riffle_shuffle();
	$deck->cut( 'short' );
	$deck->riffle_shuffle();
	print "@{$deck->get_deck()}";

Or perhaps with more precision:

	my $deck = Games::Cards::ShuffleTrack->new();

	$deck->faro_in();
	$deck->cut( 26 );
	print $deck->get_deck();

See the rest of the documentation for more advanced features. See the examples folder for more detailed usage.


=head1 INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install


=head1 DECK REPRESENTATION

At the moment a deck is represented as a list of strings; each string represents a card where the first letter or digit (or digits, in the case of a 10) is the value of the card and the following letter is the suit:

	C - Clubs
 	H - Hearts
 	S - Spades
 	D - Diamonds

As an example, some card representations:

	AC - Ace of Clubs
	10S - Ten of Spades
	4D - 4 of Diamonds
	KH - King of Hearts

Still, you can add whichever cards you want to the deck:

	$deck->put( 'Joker' ); # place a Joker on top of the deck


=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 Standard methods

=head3 new

Create a new deck.

	my $deck = Games::Cards::ShuffleTrack->new();

The order of the deck is from top to bottom, which means it is the reverse of what you see when you spread a deck in your hands with the cards facing you.

When you open most professional decks of cards you'll see the Ace of Spades (AS) in the front; this means it will actually be the 52nd card in the deck, since when you place the cards on the table facing down it will be the bottom card.

Currently this module doesn't support specific orders or different orders other than the new deck.

The order of the cards is as follows:

	Ace of Hearths through King of Hearts
	Ace of Clubs through King of Clubs
	King of Diamonds through Ace of Diamonds
	King of Spades through Ace of Spades

You can also specify the starting order of the deck among the following:

=over 4

=item * new_deck_order (the default order)

=item * fournier

=back

	my $deck = Games::Cards::ShuffleTrack->new( 'fournier' );

You can also set your own order:

	my $pile = Games::Cards::ShufleTrack->new( [qw/10S JS QS KS AS/] );

=cut

# TODO: What happens if the user has a typo in the order?
sub new {
	my ($self, $order) = @_;
	   $order ||= 'new_deck_order';

	my $cards;
	if ( ref $order eq 'ARRAY' ) {
		$cards = $order;
	}
	else {
		$cards = $decks->{ $order };
	}

	return bless {
		'deck'        => $cards,
		'original'    => $cards,
		'orientation' => 'down',
	}, $self;
}

=head3 restart

Reset the deck to its original status. The original is whatever you selected when you created the deck.

	$deck->restart;

Do bear in mind that by doing so you are replenishing the deck of whatever cards you took out of it.

=cut

sub restart {
	my $self = shift;
	return $self->_set_deck( @{$self->{'original'}} );
}


=head3 size, deck_size

Returns the size of the deck.

    my $size = $deck->deck_size;

=cut

sub size {
	my $self = shift;
	return $self->deck_size;
}

sub deck_size {
	my $self = shift;
	return scalar @{$self->{'deck'}};
}


=head3 original_size

Returns the original size of the deck.

	if ($size < 0.5 * $deck->original_size) {
		# if the deck has been exausted by over 50%
	}

=cut

sub original_size {
	my $self = shift;
	return scalar @{$self->{'original'}};
}


=head3 get_deck

Returns the deck (a reference to a list of strings).

	my $cards = $deck->get_deck();

=cut

# TODO: should we return a copy of the list instead of the list itself?
# TODO: use wantarray to allow for an array to be returned?
sub get_deck {
	my $self = shift;
	return $self->{'deck'};
}


=head3 orientation

Return whether the deck is face up or face down:

	if ( $deck->orientation eq 'down' ) {
		...
	}

The deck's orientation is either 'up' or 'down'.

=cut

sub orientation {
	my $self = shift;

	return $self->{'orientation'};
}


=head3 turn

If the deck was face up, it is turned face down; if the deck was face down, it is turned face up.

Turning the deck reverses its order.

	$deck->turn;

=cut

sub turn {
	my $self = shift;

	$self->{'orientation'} = $self->orientation eq 'down' ? 'up' : 'down';

	return $self->_set_deck( reverse @{$self->get_deck} );
}

=head3 count

Counts how many cards with specific characteristics are in the deck.

	# how many tens
	$deck->count( '10' );

	# how many Clubs
	$deck->count( 'C' );

	# how many Clubs and Hearts
	my ($clubs, $hearts) = $deck->count( 'C', 'H' );
	my $clubs_and_hearts = $deck->count( 'C', 'H' );

	# how many Jokers
	$deck->count( 'Joker' );

Since you can add whichever card you want to the deck, it should be noted how searching for values and suits works:

=over 4

=item * If looking for a value from 2 to A, you'll get the amount of cards with that value and one of the four suits

=item * If looking for a suit (C, H, S, D), you'll get the amount of cards with a value from 2 through Ace and that suit

=item * If looking for anything else, that something is compared to the whole card

=back

It is important to note:

	my $total = $deck->count( 'JC' );   # holds 4
	my $total = $deck->count( 'C', J ); # holds 16, because the JC is only counted once
	my @total = $deck->count( 'C', J ); # holds (13, 4)

Also:

	$deck->put( 'Joker' );
	$deck->put( 'Signed Joker' );
	$deck->count( 'Joker' ); # returns 2

	$deck->put( 'Signed 4C' );
	$deck->count( '4C' ); # returns 2, because you didn't removed the previous one

=cut

sub count {
	my $self = shift;
	my @results;

	if ( wantarray and @_ > 1 ) {
		return $self->_count_each( @_ );
	}
	else {
		return $self->_count_all( @_ );
	}
}

sub _count_each {
	my $self = shift;
	my @results;
	while (my $param = shift) {
		if ( exists $expressions->{$param} ) {
			push @results, scalar grep { /$expressions->{$param}/ } @{$self->get_deck};
		}
		else {
			push @results, scalar grep { /$param/ } @{$self->get_deck};
		}
	}
	return @results;
}

sub _count_all {
	my $self = shift;

	my @expressions;
	for my $param (@_) {
		push @expressions, exists $expressions->{$param} ?
							$expressions->{$param} :
							qr/$param/x,
	}

	my @results;
	for my $card (@{$self->get_deck}) {

		if (any { $card =~ $_ } @expressions) {
			push @results, $card;
		}

	}
	return scalar @results;
}


=head2 Shuffling

=head3 Overhand Shuffle

=head4 overhand_shuffle

In an overhand shuffle the cards are moved from hand to the other in packets, the result being similar to that of running cuts (the difference being that the packets in an overhand shuffle may be smaller than the ones in a running cut sequence).

	$deck->overhand_shuffle;

You can specify how many times you want to go through the deck (which is basically the same thing as calling the method that many times):

	$deck->overhand_shuffle( 2 );

=cut

sub overhand_shuffle {
	my $self  = shift;
	my $times = shift;

	if (not defined $times) {
		$times = 1;
	}

	return $self if $times < 1;

	$self->_packet_transfer( 1, 10 );

	return $times > 1 ?
		   $self->overhand_shuffle( $times - 1 ) :
		   $self
}


=head4 run

The act of running cards is similar to the overhand shuffle, but instead of in packets the cards are run singly.

	$deck->run( 10 );

When running cards you can choose whether to drop those cards on the top or on the bottom of the deck. By default, the cards are moved to the bottom of the deck.

	$deck->run( 10, 'drop-top' );
	$deck->run( 10, 'drop-bottom' );

Running cards basically reverses their order.

If no number is given then no cards are run.

If we're doing multiple runs we can set everything at the same time:

	$deck->run( 4, 6, 2 );

=cut

# TODO: review this code
sub run {
	my $self = shift;

	my @number_of_cards;
	my $where_to_drop;

	while ( my $param = shift ) {
		if ( looks_like_number( $param ) ) {
			push @number_of_cards, $param;
		}
		else {
			$where_to_drop = $param;
		}
	}

	@number_of_cards || return $self;
	$where_to_drop   ||= 'drop-bottom';

	my $number_of_cards = shift @number_of_cards;
	$number_of_cards > 0 or return $self;

	# take cards from top and reverse their order
	my @deck = @{$self->get_deck};
	my @run  = reverse splice @deck, 0, $number_of_cards;

	if ( $where_to_drop eq 'drop-top' ) {
		$self->_set_deck( @run, @deck );
	}
	else { # drop-bottom is the default
		$self->_set_deck( @deck, @run );
	}

	return $self->run( @number_of_cards, $where_to_drop );
}


=head3 Hindu Shuffle

=head4 hindu_shuffle

In a Hindu shuffle the cards are moved from hand to the other in packets, the result being similar to that of running cuts (the difference being that the packets in an overhand shuffle may be smaller than the ones in a running cut sequence).

	$deck->hindu_shuffle;

You can specify how many times you want to go through the deck (which is basically the same thing as calling the method that many times):

	$deck->hindu_shuffle( 2 );

The Hindu shuffle differs in result from the Overhand shuffle in that the packets are usually thicker; the reason for this is that while in the Overhand shuffle it's the thumb that grabs the cards (and the thumb can easily carry just one or two cards) in the Hindu shuffle it's more than one finger accomplishing this task, grabbing the deck by the sides, which makes it more difficult (hence, rare) to cut just one or two cards.

=cut

sub hindu_shuffle {
	my $self  = shift;
	my $times = shift || 1;

	$self->_packet_transfer( 4, 10 );

	return $times > 1 ?
		   $self->hindu_shuffle( $times - 1 ) :
		   $self
}

sub _packet_transfer {
	my $self = shift;
	my $min  = shift;
	my $max  = shift;

	my @deck = @{$self->get_deck};

	my @new_deck;

	while ( @deck ) {
		if (@deck < $max) { $max = scalar @deck }
		if (@deck < $min) { $min = scalar @deck }
		unshift @new_deck, splice @deck, 0, _rand( $min, $max );
	}

	return $self->_set_deck( @new_deck );
}


=head3 Riffle Shuffle

=head4 riffle_shuffle

Riffle shuffle the deck.

	$deck->riffle_shuffle();

In the act of riffle shuffling a deck the deck is cut into two halves of approximately the same size; each half is riffled so that the cards of both halves interlace; these cards usually drop in groups of 1 to 5 cards.

You can also decide where to cut the deck for the shuffle:

	$deck->riffle_shuffle( 'short' );  # closer to the top
	$deck->riffle_shuffle( 'center' ); # near the center
	$deck->riffle_shuffle( 'deep' );   # closer to the bottom
	$deck->riffle_shuffle( 26 );       # precisely under the 26th card

=cut

# TODO: add an option for an out-shuffle
# TODO: add an option to control top or bottom stock
# TODO: when dropping cards, should we favor numbers 2 and 3?
# TODO: with a lot of cards, the riffle should be done breaking the deck in piles
sub riffle_shuffle {
	my $self  = shift;
	my $depth = shift;

	# cut the deck (left pile is the original top half)
	my $cut_depth = _cut_depth( $self->deck_size, $depth );

	my @left_pile  = @{$self->get_deck};
	my @right_pile = splice @left_pile, $cut_depth;

	my @halves = ( \@left_pile, \@right_pile );

	# drop cards from the bottom of each half to the pile (1-5 at a time)
	my @new_pile = ();
	while ( @left_pile and @right_pile ) {
		my $current_half = $halves[0];
		my $number_of_cards = int(rand( min(5, scalar @$current_half) ))+1;

		unshift @new_pile, splice @$current_half, -$number_of_cards;

		@halves = reverse @halves;
	}

	# drop the balance on top and set the deck to be the result
	$self->_set_deck( @left_pile, @right_pile, @new_pile );

	return $self;
}


=head3 Faro shuffle

In a faro shuffle the deck is split in half and the two halves are interlaced perfectly so that each card from one half is inserted in between two cards from the opposite half.

=head4 faro out

Faro out the deck.

	$deck->faro( 'out' );

In a "faro out" the top and bottom cards remain in their original positions.

Considering the positions on the cards from 1 to 52 the result of the faro would be as follows:

	1, 27, 2, 28, 3, 29, 4, 30, 5, 31, 6, 32, 7, 33, ...

=head4 faro in

Faro in the deck.

	$deck->faro( 'in' );

In a "faro in" the top and bottom cards do not remain in their original positions (top card becomes second from the top, bottom card becomes second from the bottom).

Considering the positions on the cards from 1 to 52 the result of the faro would be as follows:

	27, 1, 28, 2, 29, 3, 30, 4, 31, 5, 32, 6, 33, 7, ...

=cut

sub faro {
	my $self = shift;
	my $faro = shift; # by default we're doing a faro out

	# TODO: what happens when the deck is odd-sized?
	my @first_half  = @{$self->get_deck};
	my @second_half = splice @first_half, $self->deck_size / 2;

	$self->_set_deck(
			$faro eq 'in' ?
			zip @second_half, @first_half :
			zip @first_half,  @second_half
		);

	return $self;
}


=head2 Cutting

=head3 cut

Cut the deck.

	$deck->cut();

In a 52 cards deck, this would cut somewhere between 10 and 43 cards.

Cut at a precise position (moving X cards from top to bottom):

	$deck->cut(26);

If you try to cut to a position that doesn't exist nothing will happen (apart from a warning that you tried to cut to a non-existing position, of course).

You can also cut at negative positions, meaning that you're counting from the bottom of the deck and cutting above that card. For instance, to cut the bottom two cards to the top:

	$deck->cut(-2);

Additional ways of cutting:

	$deck->cut( 'short'  ); # on a 52 cards deck, somewhere between 5  and 15 cards
	$deck->cut( 'center' ); # on a 52 cards deck, somewhere between 19 and 31 cards
	$deck->cut( 'deep'   ); # on a 52 cards deck, somewhere between 35 and 45 cards

=head3 cut_below

You can cut below a specific card.

	$deck->cut_below( '9D' );

If the desired card is already on the bottom of the deck nothing will happen.

For more information on how to cut to a specific card please refer to the L<SEE ALSO> section of this documentation.

=head3 cut_above

You can cut above a specific card.

	$deck->cut_above( 'JS' );

If the desired card is already on top of the deck nothing will happen.

For more information on how to cut to a specific card please refer to the L<SEE ALSO> section of this documentation.

=cut

# TODO: delimit randomness of the cut between two numbers: $deck->cut( 1, 25 );
sub cut {
	my $self     = shift;
	my $position = shift;

	if (     defined $position
		 and looks_like_number( $position )
		 and abs($position) > $self->deck_size ) {
				warn "Tried to cut the deck at a non-existing position ($position).\n";
				return $self;
	}

	my $cut_depth = _cut_depth( $self->deck_size, $position );

	my @deck = @{$self->get_deck};
	unshift @deck, splice @deck, $cut_depth;

	return $self->_set_deck( @deck );
}

sub cut_below {
	my $self = shift;
	my $card = shift;

	return $self->cut( $self->find( $card ) );
}

sub cut_above {
	my $self = shift;
	my $card = shift;

	return $self->cut( $self->find( $card ) - 1 );
}

=head3 cut_to

Cuts a portion of the deck to another position

	$deck->cut_to( $pile );

You can specify exactly how many cards to cut or delimit the randomness of the cut:

	# cut exactly 15 cards to $pile
	$deck->cut_to( $pile, 15 );

	# cut between 10 and 26 cards to $pile
	$deck->cut_to( $pile, 10, 26 );

If the position doesn't exist yet you can also automatically create it:

	my $pile = $deck->cut_to();

This method returns the new pile.

=cut

sub cut_to {
	my $self = shift;

	# create the new pile if required
	my $new_pile;
	if ( defined($_[0]) and ref( $_[0] ) eq 'Games::Cards::ShuffleTrack' ) {
		$new_pile = shift;
	}
	else {
		$new_pile = Games::Cards::ShuffleTrack->new( 'empty' );
	}

	# TODO: could this be done with _cut_depth? (perhaps changing it a bit)
	# set the position
	my $lower_limit = shift;
	my $upper_limit = shift;

	my $position;

	if ( not defined $lower_limit ) {
		$position = _rand( 1, $self->deck_size );
	}
	elsif ( not defined $upper_limit ) {
		$position = $lower_limit;
	}
	else {
		$position = _rand( $lower_limit, $upper_limit );
	}

	# cut the deck
	$new_pile->place_on_top( splice @{$self->get_deck}, 0, $position );

	return $new_pile;
}


=head3 place_on_top

Places a pile of cards on top of the deck.

	$deck->place_on_top( qw/AS KS QS JS 10S/ );

=cut

# TODO place_on_top and put share similar code; review
sub place_on_top {
	my $self = shift;
	my @pile = @_;

	$self->_set_deck( @pile, @{$self->get_deck} );

	return $self;
}

=head3 complete_cut, move_to

Complete the cut by moving all cards from one deck onto another:

	$deck->complete_cut( $new_pile );
	
	# or

	$deck->move_to( $table );

=cut

sub complete_cut {
	my $self = shift;
	my $destination = shift;

	$self->cut_to( $destination, $self->deck_size );

	return $self;
}

sub move_to {
	my $self = shift;

	return $self->complete_cut( @_ );
}


=head3 running_cuts

Cut packets:

    $deck->running_cuts();

To do the procedure twice:

    $deck->running_cuts( 2 );

=cut

sub running_cuts {
	my $self  = shift;
	my $times = shift || 1;

	$self->_packet_transfer( 5, 15 );

	return $times > 1 ?
		   $self->overhand_shuffle( $times - 1 ) :
		   $self
}


=head2 Handling cards

There are a few different methods to track down cards.

=head3 find

Get the position of specific cards:

	my $position = $deck->find( 'AS' ); # find the position of the Ace of Spades

	my @positions = $deck->find( 'AS', 'KH' ); # find the position of two cards

If a card is not present on the deck the position returned will be a 0.

This method can also return the card at a specific position:

	my $card = $deck->find( 3 );

You can also request a card in a negative position (i.e., from the bottom of the deck). To get the second to last card in the deck:

	$deck->find( -2 );

If you're dealing five hands of poker from the top of the deck, for instance, you can easily find which cards will fall on the dealer's hand:

	$deck->find( 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 );

=cut

sub find {
	my $self  = shift;
	my @cards = @_;

	my @results;

	my $deck = $self->get_deck();

	for my $card ( @cards ) {

		push @results, looks_like_number( $card )
					 ? $self->_find_card_by_position( $card )
					 : $self->_find_card_by_name( $card );

	}

	return wantarray ? @results : $results[0];
}

sub _find_card_by_position {
	my $self = shift;
	my $card = shift;

	if ($card) {
		if ($card > 0) { $card--; }
		return $card > $self->deck_size - 1 ?
		        q{} :
		        $self->get_deck->[ $card ];
	}
	else {
		return q{};
	}
}

sub _find_card_by_name {
	my $self = shift;
	my $card = shift;

	my $position = 1 + first_index { $_ eq $card } @{$self->get_deck};

	return $position ? $position : 0;
}


=head3 find_card_before

Finds the card immediately before another card:

	# return the card immediately before the Ace of Spades
	$deck->find_card_before( 'AS' );

If the specified card is on top of the deck you will get the card on the bottom of the deck.

=cut

sub find_card_before {
	my $self = shift;
	my $card = shift;

	my $position = $self->find( $card );

	if ($position == 1) {
		return 0;
	}
	else {
		return $self->find( $position - 1 );
	}
}


=head3 find_card_after

Finds the card immediately after another card:

	# return the card immediately after the King of Hearts
	$deck->find_card_before( 'KH' );

If the specified card is on the bottom of the deck you will get the card on the top of the deck.

=cut

sub find_card_after {
	my $self = shift;
	my $card = shift;

    my $position = 1 + $self->find( $card );
    
    if ( $position > $self->deck_size ) {
        return 0;
    }

	return $self->find( $self->find( $card ) + 1 );
}


=head3 distance

Find the distance between two cards.

To find the distance between the Ace of Spades and the King of Hearts:

	$deck->distance( 'AS', 'KH' );

If the King of Hearts is just after the Ace of Spades, then the result is 1. If it's immediately before, the result is -1.

=cut

sub distance {
	my $self        = shift;
	my $first_card  = shift;
	my $second_card = shift;

	return $self->find( $second_card) - $self->find( $first_card );
}


=head3 put

Put a card on top of the deck. This is a new card, and not a card already on the deck.

	$deck->put( $card );

If the card was already on the deck, you now have a duplicate card.

=cut

sub put {
	my $self = shift;
	my $card = shift;

	$self->_set_deck( $card, @{$self->get_deck} );

	return $self;
}


=head3 insert

Inserts a card in a specified position in the deck. If the position isn't specified than the card is inserted somewhere at random.

	# insert a Joker at position 20
	$deck->insert( 'Joker', 20 );

	# replace a card somewhere in the deck at random
	$deck->insert( $card );

If the position doesn't exist the card will be replaced at the bottom of the deck.

You can also add cards to negative positions, meaning that the resulting position will be that negative position:

    # insert card so that it ends up being the last one in the deck
	$deck->insert( $card, -1 );

    # insert card so that it ends up being the 10th from the bottom
	$deck->insert( $card, -10 );

=cut

# TODO: what if the user inserts at position 0?
sub insert {
	my $self     = shift;
	my $card     = shift;
	my $position = shift;

	if ( not defined $position ) {
		$position = _rand( 1, $self->deck_size );
	}
	elsif ( $position > $self->deck_size ) {
		$position = $self->deck_size + 1;
	}
	elsif ( $position < 0 ) {
		$position = $self->deck_size + $position + 2;
	}

	splice @{$self->get_deck}, $position - 1, 0, $card;

	return $self;
}


=head3 deal

Deals a card, removing it from the deck.

	my $removed_card = $deck->deal();

Just as in regular gambling, you can deal cards from other positions:

	# deal the second card from the top
    my $card = $deck->deal( 'second' );

    # deal the second card from the bottom
    my $card = $deck->deal( 'greek' );

    # deal the card from the bottom of the deck
    my $card = $deck->deal( 'bottom' );

For more information on false dealing see the L<SEE ALSO> section.

If you're dealing cards to a pile you can actually state where you're dealing:

	$deck->deal( $pile );

You can still do a false deal to a pile:

	$deck->deal( 'second', $pile );

	# or

	$deck->deal( $pile, 'second' );

=cut

# TODO: deal from an empty deck?
sub deal {
	my $self = shift;

	if (not $self->size) {
		warn "Tried to deal without cards.\n";
		return $self;
	}

	my $deal        = 'top';
	my $destination = undef;
	while (my $param = shift) {
		if ( ref( $param ) eq 'Games::Cards::ShuffleTrack' ) {
			$destination = $param;
		}
		elsif ( exists $shortcuts->{$param} ) {
			$deal = $param;
		}
	}

	my $position = $shortcuts->{$deal};

	my $card = $self->remove( $position );

	if ( defined $destination ) {
		return $destination->put( $card );
	}
	else {
		return $card;
	}
}

=head3 remove

Removes a card from the deck.

	# remove the 4th card from the top
	my $card = $deck->remove( 4 );

=cut

# TODO: allow removal of several cards (do note that positions change as cards are removed)
sub remove {
	my $self     = shift;
	my $position = shift;

	my @deck = @{$self->get_deck};

    if ($position > 0) { $position--; }

	my $card = splice @deck, $position, 1;

	$self->_set_deck( @deck );
	return $card;
}


=head3 peek

Peek at a position in the deck (this is essentially the same thing as &find()).

	# peek the top card
	my $card = $deck->peek( 1 );

You can also peek the top and bottom card by using an alias:

	# peek the top card
	my $card = $deck->peek( 'top' );

	# peek the bottom card
	my $card = $deck->peek( 'bottom' );

Negative indexes are also supported:

	# peek the second from bottom card
	my $card = $deck->peek( -2 );

=cut

sub peek {
	my $self     = shift;
	my $position = shift || 1;

	if (_is_shortcut( $position )) {
		$position = $shortcuts->{$position};
	}

	return $self->find( $position );
}


=head3 take_random

Remove a random card from the deck.

	my $random_card = $deck->take_random();

You can also specify limits (if you're somehow directing the person taking the card to a particular section of the deck):

	my $random_card = $deck->take_random( 13, 39 );

=cut

sub take_random {
	my $self = shift;

	my $lower_limit = shift || 1;
	my $upper_limit = shift;

	$upper_limit = defined $upper_limit ?
					$upper_limit :
					$self->deck_size;

	return $self->remove( _rand( $lower_limit, $upper_limit ) );
}

=head3 dribble

Dribble the cards (usually to select one, which could either be the last one to fall or the one that would be next).

	# dribble cards onto $pile
	$deck->dribble( $pile );

	# same thing, but declaring $pile
    $pile = $deck->dribble;

    # dribble to position 10 (in a 52 card deck, 42 cards would fall)
    $deck->dribble( 10 );

    # dribble 10 cards
    $deck->dribble( -10 );

    # dribble to position between 10 and 20
    $deck->dribble( 10, 20 );

    # dribble to position between 10th from the top and 10th from the bottom
    $deck->dribble( 10, -10 );

=cut

# TODO: what happens if you're dribbling and have no cards?
sub dribble {
	my $self   = shift;
	my $params = _parse_params( @_ );

	my $has_destination = @{$params->{'places'}};
	my $destination = $has_destination ?
						$params->{'places'}[0] :
						Games::Cards::ShuffleTrack->new( 'empty' );

	my ($lower_limit, $upper_limit) = $self->_fix_limits( @{$params->{'numbers'}} );

	if ( defined $lower_limit ) {
		$lower_limit = $self->size - $lower_limit;
		$upper_limit = defined $upper_limit ?
						$self->size - $upper_limit :
						$lower_limit;
	}
	else {
		# FIXME: this means we can't dribble if we have just 5 cards
		$lower_limit = 5; # minimum amount of cards to hold back
		$upper_limit = $self->size - 5; # minimum amount of cards to dribble
	}

	$self->turn;
	my $transfer = $self->cut_to( $lower_limit, $upper_limit );
	$transfer->turn;
	$transfer->move_to( $destination );

	return $has_destination ? $self : $destination;
}
